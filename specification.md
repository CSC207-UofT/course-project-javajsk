## Food Truck Ordering App

Our app will have two user interfaces. One for users that want to order food from food trucks
and another for vendors that are selling food from food trucks. Both the customers and vendors need accounts 
to access our application that is secured with password-based authentication.


Customers buying food will be able to see which food trucks are open on campus via a map that shows the food trucks as pins.
Customers are capable of seeing the menus of all the food trucks and in the menu of a given food truck, they can search for items or sort by price.
Customers can only add food items from one food truck at a time since they can't order from multiple food trucks in the same order.
Food items will have photos, the pricing, and a short description. Multiple food items can also be combined to form a combo deal.
After selecting all the desired food items, the customer can check out which sends the order to the food truck vendors.
Users can track their order status to see if their order is cancelled, processing, confirmed, or completed. 
Before an order is confirmed by the vendor, the customer is still allowed to cancel their order.
Customers can also view their order history as well as keep track of their favourite menu items and orders that allow for quick repurchases.
Lastly after making a purchase at a specific food truck, the user is permitted to leave a review about their experience.

Vendors that own a food truck are able to create a food truck in our system. They will build their food truck menu by adding food items with the pricing, photos, and description of their product. 
They can update the menu by adding and removing items as well as changing the attributes of existing menu items.
Vendors are able to specify the sold out items so that they no longer appear on their menu.
If the vendors are feeling generous, they can also easily set up discounts for their food truck.
Vendors can set their current location and indicate when they are opened or closed. 
When a customer places an order, the vendor is able to see the order as well as the customer's profile then decide whether to confirm or reject it.
When it gets busy, the vendor will see a queue of all the orders including the incoming ones and the ones that are already confirmed.
Once an order is ready, they can update the order status and mark it as complete.
