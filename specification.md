# UofTruck

At the University of Toronto, students like to order from food trucks, such as the ones that are commonly found on St. George st. The goal of this app is to allow students to place online orders for food from these food trucks on campus. A system like this would make life easier for both students and food truck vendors, since it allows students to save time while allowing food truck vendors to better expedite their orders.

Each food truck has a unique menu that contains different types of items, including normal items such as burgers or fries, but also combo items such as burger combo with fries and drink. A customer might also choose to customize their order - for example, one customer might want extra lettuce inside their wrap, and another might not want any pickles in their burger. Furthermore, individual food trucks might do things like deals or discounts.

As for the food trucks themselves, there are many food trucks around campus, each with their own locations and opening hours. Some food trucks may be unavailable on certain days.

Customers using this app would want to be able to log into some sort of account, especially since they are disclosing their personal information within the app. They would want their payments and transactions to be secure and smooth. From within the app, they should be able to browse all food trucks, view menus, order food, and view their order history.

Vendors, on the other hand, would also want to be able to log into some sort of account to be able to manage their food truck, which is essentially an online shop. They should be able to modify their shop by adding or removing items, updating item information such as prices, discounts, or components of the item (such as removing combo pieces). They should be able to update their opening and closing times at will. They should also be able to view their current orders, and choose to accept and confirm orders or decline them.

Finally, this product will be used in real time, with customers interacting with vendors in real time in a number of ways. Since ordering food should be a fast process, the interactions should be quick and easy for both sides.
