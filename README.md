# Progress Report

# Running Demo
If you want to run the Demo, run the main method and follow the prompts shown in the console. The login information can be found hard-coded into main for demonstration purposes(there will be a more robust solution implemented later for login information). There isn't perfect input handling or edge case handling but it is functional enough to have a customer place an order and a vendor to be able to see and process that order. 

First, login to the Customer account place an order. Then, login to the Vendor account and see and process that order. That is the entire functionality of this primative demo.
