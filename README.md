# Project JavaJSK - FoodTruck System

Name TBA

# Problem specification
Our problem that we intend to solve and it's specification can be found [here](/specification.md).

# Progress Report
We are constantly updating the progress we make on this program, to get the latest information
please view the document listed as [progress_report](progress_report.md).

# Running Demo
If you want to run the Demo run the main method and follow the prompts in the console. The log in information can be found hard-coded into main for demonstration purposes. There isn't perfect input handling or edge case handling but it is functional enough to have a customer place an order and a vendor to be able to see and process that order.
