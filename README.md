Name TBA

# Problem specification
Our problem that we intend to solve and it's specification can be found [here](/specification.md).

# Progress Report
We are constantly updating the progress we make on this program, to get the latest information
please view the document listed as [progress_report](progress_report.md).

# Running The Demo
In order to run the demo using our skeleton code, run the main method under Main.java and follow the prompts shown in the console. The login information can be found hard-coded into main method for demonstration purposes (there will be a more robust solution implemented later for login information). To login as the user/customer, use the username "User" and password "user_password". To login as the vendor, use the User ID "Vendor" and password "vendor_password". There isn't perfect input handling or edge case handling but it is functional enough to have a customer place an order and a vendor to be able to see and process that order. 

First, login to the Customer account place an order. Then, login to the Vendor account and see and process that order. That is the entire functionality of this primative demo. 

# Unit Test
The unit test for our skeleton code can be found under the DMSTest.java file. This unit test is for a method in DMS.java.
