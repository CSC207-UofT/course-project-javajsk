### Specification

At the University of Toronto, many on-campus students like to order from food trucks, such as the ones that are commonly found on St. George st. The goal of this app is to allow students to place online orders for food from these food trucks on campus. A system like this would make life easier for both students and food truck vendors, since it allows students to save time while allowing food truck vendors to better expedite their orders.

Each food truck has a unique menu that contains different types of items, including normal items such as burgers or fries, but also combo items such as burger combo with fries and drink. A customer might also choose to customize their order - for example, one customer might want extra lettuce inside their wrap, and another might not want any pickles in their burger.
